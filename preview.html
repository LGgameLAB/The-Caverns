<ul>
<li>Begin to develop the core aspects about the game including the idea of a &quot;light source&quot; that controls your energy and stats. Ideas to build on this could include:<ul>
<li>The light source diminishes from the player inside of caves as his contained light energy goes down</li>
<li>The player has a crystal that emmits the light which additionally contains it and must be refilled by travelling to the surface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make enemy generators</li>
<li>Give enemies attack based combat and write a projectile script</li>
<li>Make overworld</li>
</ul>

<li><del>Capatilize all classes</del></li>
